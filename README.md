## About Project

This project was created as a SPA that can help users create QR codes easily.

I made it becuase I was tired of bloated webstes that were slow and had too many ads. I wanted to make a simple and easy to use QR code generator that was fast and efficient. I hope you enjoy using it!

## Features

-   Customize the colors
-   Customize the size
-   Custome URL that is actually encoded in the QR code, and not a redirect link to the destination website.
-   Download the QR code as a PNG
